    # Proxy API requests to Gateway if needed, or strictly rely on CORS
    # Since we use absolute URLs in api.js (localhost:8080), we rely on CORS.
    # But in Docker network, frontend browser is outside.
    # The browser still hits localhost:8080 for API, which maps to Gateway container.
    # So CORS is needed (already added in Gateway).
